## Business Scope
There are two entity that is being involved: `customer` and the `platform`. For the `platform` itself can be categorized into 2 more: `operator`, `system`.

Note that for exam purpose the `platform` part is ignored and the focus is more into the `customer`


## Technical Design
Used stacks:
- Programming Language: Go version 1.22.1 or above (https://go.dev/)
- Database: MariaDB version 10.10 (https://mariadb.org/) or MySQL with the evquivalent version (https://www.mysql.com)
- Memory Storage: Redis (https://redis.io/)
- Project Layout: Golang Standard Project Layout (https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) - this is just reference not reallly a stack

Based on the needs and according to the `go-project-standard-layout`, there are 3 directories that are being used:
- `internal`: consists any logic related to the business flow, which follows `Clean Architecture` (`CA`) approach
- `pkg`: consists any logic that are not related to the business flow
- `cmd`: consists any executabble parts that run the services (acctually only one service for exam purpose)

### More About `internal` Directory
To make it more organized, the files are grouped into 3 main parts or layers (according to the `CA` as mentioned previously) as follows:
- `entities` aka `domain`, containing files that define the data structure
- `use-cases` aka `application`, containing files that decide how the flows go
- `interfaces` aka `presentation`, containing files process user request and create responses in return.

Note:
- there are 2 models of `CA` approach: 3 layers and 4 layers. The 4 layers sparates interfaces into 2 more parts.
- the `cmd` directory also can be considered part of the `interfaces`

### More About `pkg` Directory
All of the codes within the directory are taken from several projects that are previously used by the author (the exam participant).


## Running The Project
### Preparation
- Make sure the main stack (`Go`, `MariaDB`, `Redis`) with the specified version above are already installed.
- Create database with the desired name on the `MariaDB` server.
- Clone the repository `https://github.com/munaja/deals-yc-w22` into the local PC
- Go to the project directory that has been cloned
- Run command `go mod tidy` to install dependency.

### Database Migration
- From the project directory, go to `cmd/all-db-migration`
- Create file named `.env` which can be copied from file `.env-example`
- Modify the file `.env` that has been created, adjust the database setting for the `dsn` key according to the environment, using format `{user}:{pass}@tcp({host}:{port})/dbname?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local`.
- Run command `go run .` to directly execute it, or
- Run command `go build .` to create the executabble file, then execute it.

### Running the Application
- From the project directory, go to `cmd/customer`
- Create file named `.env` which can be copied from file `.env-example`
- Modify the file `.env` that has been created, adjust the http server, database (which similar to the previous sample), and memory storage (example config uses default value) setting according to the environment.
- Run command `go run .` to directly execute it, or
- Run command `go build .` to create the executabble file, then execute it.

### API Documentation
Testing can be done using `postman` directly please import the collection which is available in the project repository under `request-doc` directory. The collection name is `Deals YC W22`.

Some special flow of the request:
- Account registration needs an activation, which will be included in the result if the `env` in the `.env` is set to `development`, for example result will have a note similar to this  `For Dev Only: use this path '/account/confirm-by-email?email=santoso_03@gmail.com&token=fb8bbf42-c36d-4be2-a36a-3af4a471bf56' to activate account`. There for after registration please access the given path `/account/confirm-by-email?email=santoso_03@gmail.com&token=fb8bbf42-c36d-4be2-a36a-3af4a471bf56` from postman which available under `Account` directory request `Request Confirmation By Email`
- Login will return data with access token as one of it's field. Will be needed in most of the case as bearer token. Put in the token field, under the main direcotry > `Authorization` tab > type `Bearer Token`
